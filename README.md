# Gen4Pokemon60FPSPatcher

### Gen 4 Pokemon 60FPS Patcher
* A patcher to modify the Generation 4 Pokémon games to run in 60FPS

### Setup to get this patcher working
* Have one of the following ROMs
  * Pokémon Diamond
  * Pokémon Pearl
  * Pokémon Platinum
  * Pokémon HeartGold
  * Pokémon SoulSilver
* Navigate to the game you'd like to patch and select the ROM
* Please be patient when your ROM is being patched. It'll look like nothing is happening, but wait for the confirmation that it's done
* Have fun playing the Gen 4 Pokémon games in 60FPS!

### Note if planning to use the randomizer
* **Patch your ROM first with this before using the randomizer**
* The randomizer will shuffle bytes around, and I'm not sure if it'll work after the randomizer modifies the ROM, so to be on the safe side just use this first
  * This will have your ROM come up as unsupported, but that's because it no longer matches a known hash. Everything should still randomize properly regardless of that
